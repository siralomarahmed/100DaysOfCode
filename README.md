# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge


## Introduction

This serve as a public coding journal, to record the progress, with a main commitment, to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Usually with a goal to achieve a result or advancement in learning a programming language.


## Rules

1. Code a minimum of one hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet the progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag
3. Coding at work won't count towards the challenge
4. Push the code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see the progress
5. Update the "Log" file with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see the progress
