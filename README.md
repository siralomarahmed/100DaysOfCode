# What is this?

This repository is inspired from Alexander Kallaway 100-days-of-code challenge. If you've decided to look into it, you can find him on [GitHub](https://github.com/kallaway), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ka11away) or [The Official Site](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) of the challenge. 

I've joined the #100DaysOfCode challenge and completed it multiple of times then found out that if I document my progress or just the thoughts of the progress, it may be helpful for someone else who want to learn the same programming langauge. As for advanced coders, this may not be intersting.

This repository serve as a small journal that document some thoughts of my own progress of learning how to code in a specific computer languages for 100 day. I find the progress of the challenge itself refreshing, and keeps me coding and programming everyday regardless if it's a workday, weekend, holiday or even a new year.


## Rules

1. Code a minimum of one hour every day for the next 100 days
    * One hour is short, and sometimes very short, but it works!
2. Tweet the progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag
    * I find it awkward, but I do it regardless.
3. Coding at work won't count towards the challenge
4. Push the code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see the progress
5. Update the "Log" file with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see the progress
6. Write a conclusion or a final statement about the hours spent in the specific language
