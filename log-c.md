## C Programming Language
 
Developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973. C has been standardized by the The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.
 
The C programming language is evolved from a previous programming language named B. It uses many of the important concepts of the B language while adding data typing and other features. The B programming language was a typeless language. Every data item occupied one word in memory. It was a hustle to type variables and was considered a burden on the programmer head.
 
The main features of C is that it is efficient, portable, flexible and programmer oriented.
 
C is:
1. A general purpose language. A computer language that is broadly applicable across application domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain.
2. Procedural. It's a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based on the concept of the procedure call.
3. Structured. It's a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program.
4. Static type checking. It's the process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program's source code.
5. Cross platform. Is a computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms.
6. C programming language uses a compiler. Compiler is a program that translates the high-level language into the detailed set of machine language instructions that the computer requires.
7. A modern Programming language:
    * Has basic control structure and features
    * Top-bottom planning
    * Modular design, aka structured programming or functions
    * Readable and reliable
 
*Main Commitment*:
 
I will learn and code in the **C** programming language for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
 
The standard version of the language I will use is based on C89 and C99 but I may use some of the new features of C11 and C18.
