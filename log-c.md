# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Ahmed A. M. Alomar
 
## C Programming Language
 
Developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973. C has been standardized by the The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.
 
The C programming language is evolved from a previous programming language named B. It uses many of the important concepts of the B language while adding data typing and other features. The B programming language was a typeless language. Every data item occupied one word in memory. It was a hustle to type variables and was considered a burden on the programmer head.
 
The main features of C is that it is efficient, portable, flexible and programmer oriented.
 
The C Programming language is:
1. A general purpose language. A computer language that is broadly applicable across application domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain.
2. Procedural. It's a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based on the concept of the procedure call.
3. Structured. It's a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program.
4. Static type checking. It's the process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program's source code.
5. Cross platform. Is a computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms.
6. C programming language uses a compiler. Compiler is a program that translates the high-level language into the detailed set of machine language instructions that the computer requires.
7. A modern Programming language:
    * Has basic control structure and features
    * Top-bottom planning
    * Modular design, aka structured programming or functions
    * Readable and reliable
 
*Main Commitment*:
 
I will learn and code in the **C** programming language for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
 
The standard version of the language I will use is based on C89 and C99 but I may use some of the new features of C11.

### Day 1: January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Hello World
 
**Thoughts:** I installed the Cygwin compiler and run the first console app written in C. I can say that I understand a little bit about the basic structure of the C program by looking at it.
 
The `#include` is a preprocessor command. They are also called preprocessor directives. It is a unique feature of the C programming language that is not found in many other higher-level programming languages. Its function is to make the development of programs easier to modify and to port to different computer systems.
 
The `<stdio.h>` is a library that includes many commands and it is included here because I used the `printf` function. this means that the declaration of the `printf` function is taken from the library `<stdio.h>`.
 
The `printf()` is a standard library function to output or display output to the command line. The idea is that you don't have to write a custom function to do this simple task every time.

The `int` is there to return an integer that represents a message. The return keyword is used at the end of the block of code. You can use `void` to not return anything. You can also say that int is the return type of the function.
 
I can easily say that `main()` is a function of some sort but I don't intend to say I understand how functions run in C yet. Following that a block of code that prints the string. How can I put it into words.. When the operating system execute the program, it will look for the main function. The main function will return a value and the `int` integer is the type of value that this function will return. This is why the `return 0;` at the end of the function block.
 
It is a standard in the C programming language that you return zero to indicate that the program has completed successfully.
 
The four fundamental tasks in writing a C program as any compiled language is:
  1. Editing
  2. Compiling
  3. Linking
  4. Executing
 
Editing is writing the C code in a file that is called the source code file. All source code files must end with the extension `.c`.
 
Main points in editing C code is:
  * Case sensitivity
  * All statements end with a semicolon
 
There a phase before compilation which is called a
  * Preprocessing phase, during which the code may be modified or added to.
 
The compiler will then translate the assembly language statements into machine code. After this phase, the compiling stage will do an actual compilation that generate the object code. The output of the compiler is known as object code with the `.o` or `.obj` file extension.
 
After the program has been translated into Object code, it is linked. The purpose of linking is to get the program into a final form for execution on the computer. Linking is usually automatic but sometimes must be done manually.
 
Executing is about running the program.

### Day 2: January 2, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Comments and Escape Sequences
 
**Thoughts:** It is best practice to use comments to explain complex code or give needed information if needed. The core reason for comment is to enhance the code readability. They are ignored by the compiler.
 
There are two ways to add comments in a C Program:
  1. Single line comments using `//`
      * The content of the comment is after the double forward slashes.
  2. Multiline comments using `/**/`
      * THe content of the comment is between the asterisks.
 
Escape sequence is represented with the backslash `\` followed by a sequence of characters. it's also called an escape character. The escape sequence can be used on any system with a C compiler.
 
Some of the escape characters are: 
 
* `\\` will add a backslash
* `\b` will add a backspace
* `\n` will give a newline
* `\?` will add a question mark by avoiding trigraphs
* `\'` will escape a single quote
* `"` will escape a double quotation

### Day 3: January 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Program Structure

**Thoughts:** Today I coded the hello world program and a variation of it, so I decided to know the structure of the C programs. I did my research and learn a lot of things.

For now I can understand that the structure of a C program consist of 3 main Statements and they are:

1. Link Statements
    * Includes preprocessor statements
2. Definition Statements
    * Includes global declaration statements
3. Function Statements
    * Includes the main function

I've also seen that people like to add comments that explain the program at the top of the code. Before anything in the source file, there will be a section that help the coder to know what is going on. Some sort of documentation.

I still didn't learn about function in the C programming language but It is easy to guess that a program can have many functions aside from the main function.

My conclusion is that the program structure will be:

1. Documentation
    * Which usually contains the collection of comment lines giving the name of the program, the author's or programmer's name and few other details.
2. Connections
    * Which instructs the compiler to connect to the various functions from the system library
3. Definitions
    * Which describes all the symbolic-constants. It is also the place used to define those variables that are used globally within the entire program.
4. Functionalities
    * Where the main function and user-defined functions is.

### Day 4: January 4, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Preprocessor Basics
 
**Thoughts:** The preprocessor is part of the compilation process in the C programming language that recognize special statements. I can say that it is an instruction to the compiler to do something before compiling the processing of the code.
 
A preprocessor is:
 
  1. Statements starts with the hashtag `#` this symbol indicates this is a preprocessing directive.
  2. It is a rule for the compiler to do something before compiling the source code.
  3. Must be the first non-space character on the line.
  4. They are usually at the top of the source code but can be anywhere.
 
You can create your own macros or build a library files using a preprocessor. Macros are another preprocessor that you can modify to create a more powerful programs. Macros are typically created with the `#define` preprocessor command, and libraries are typically created with the `#include` preprocessor command.
 
A preprocessor derivative would be things such as conditional statements.
 
A preprocessor `#include` calls a file. in the case of today's program, it is the file `stdio.h`, It is called a header file. Because it is usually included at the head of a program file with the `.h` extension.
 
Header files usually has information about functions provided to the program. In the case of `stdio.h`, it is the standard C library header that give functions to things such as displaying output. In the case of today, it is to make use of the `printf()` function. You can say that it is a standard of input/output functionalities.
 
There are two ways to include header files:
 
  1. using angle brackets `<HeaderFile>`
      This method will make the preprocessor to look for the file in one or more standard system directories.
  2. Using double quotation `"HeaderFile"`
      This method will make the preprocessor to first look at the current directory. Probably something the user made.
 
Header files can be :
  * Define directives
  * Structure declarations
  * Type definition statements
  * Function prototypes

### Day 5: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Variables - Declaration

**Thoughts:** Variable is an identifier with a value that can be changed during normal execution.

The act of creating a named address in the memory and assigning a type of data to it is called variable declarations.
 
I know by now that variables are just a named storage of data in the memory (RAM). I've researched a lot and simplified the process of variables in relation to the memory so I can understand the functionality better into points.
 
* When the program store information on the random access memory:
    * RAM is a temporary storage for the data or instructions
    * The size has measurement units called bits
    * Each bit represents a binary digit, either a 0 or 1
    * the bit is full when it's value is 1
    * It is empty when it's value is 0
    * Bits in memory is grouped into a set of eight bits to create a byte
    * Each byte has a unique address that can be referenced to
* Variables are the name you give to point to the memory location that are used to store values in the program:
    * Constant, are data type that remain static throughout the program. (cannot change there value)
    * Variables, are data type that are dynamic throughout the program. (can change their value)
 
It is best practice to create meaningful names for the variables to increase the readability of the code. The usual naming practices such as no keywords, spaces or `$` in the name. Also a variable name cannot start with a number.
 
In order to use a variable in a program, You have to declare them first. It is the act of naming the variable and giving a type for the data in it. Because the C programming language requires all variables to be declared to be used in a program.
 
Syntax:  `type-specifier variable-name;`

### Day 6: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Variables - Initializing

**Thoughts:** The act of giving the variable a value is called initializing variable.
 
Declaring variables are one thing and giving them values is another thing. If both processes are linked together it is called initializing variables.
 
Initialize syntax: `variable-name = variable-value;`
 
Declare and initialize syntax: `type-specifier variable-name = variable-value;`

### Day 7: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Variables - Format Specifier

**Thoughts:** There are types of data in the C programming language and each type has its own specifier that represent the data. These specifiers are required to print the value assigned to a variable.

The format specifier will search for a parameter, usually it is going to be the variable name. You can add as many parameters as you like providing the format specifier to print it in the program.

Specifiers can be used in many ways. In a `printf()` function, when you add the specifier, you have to add the variable name as a second parameter in the function.

Syntax: `printf("%formatSpecifier", variableName);`

In the case of integer `int` variable type, the format specifier is `%d`

There are two types of the basic integer and they are both of size 16 bits:

1. Basic signed integer type:
    * Keywords:
      * int
      * signed
      * signed int
    * Format Specifier:
      * %i
      * %d

Capable of containing at least the [−32,767, +32,767] range.

1. Basic unsigned integer type:
    * Keywords:
      * unsigned 
      * unsigned int
    * Format Specifier:
      * %u

Capable of containing at least the [0, 65,535] range.

### Day 8: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Variables - Display & Read Data

**Thoughts:** Now I understand more about how variable function in the C programming language, I can see the picture more clearly. I know by now that the `scanf` function from the library `stdio.h` is used to get data from the keyboard. Getting the value give me the choice to assign it to a variable.
 
To assign an input from the user to a variable in the program, the variable must first be declared.

To display information on the screen terminal, you can use the `printf()` function as in the hello world program. you can even specify the format of the data you want to display.
 
The `scanf()` function takes two parameters separated by commas. The first enclosed with double quotation is what format specifier to display.
 
The operating system set between the user and the hardware. When the user enters data, the computer will store it in the hardware, specifically the memory. The way the computer store data is by sequence of characters, not by type. The `scanf()` function will scan for the characters stored in the memory and the format specifier will convert the data into what type has been specified.
 
Since the variable will be declared in a local scope, the `scanf()` function will not be able to access the local variable.
 
Then `scanf()` need to know where to assign the value another way. Here is the second parameter comes into play. The second parameter will tell where to keep that value. It is by passing the address or the byte number of the variable in the memory to the function.
 
In the C Programming language, you can point to the address of the variable in memory by prefixing (join together) the `&` sign with the variable name.
 
Getting the format specifier, Syntax: `"%specfierKey"`
 
Getting the address of the variable, Syntax: `&variableName`

### Day 15: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Data types - Boolean

**Thoughts:** Boolean data type functions similarly to a normal integers type, with one exception: any assignments to a _Bool that are not 0 (false) are stored as 1 (true).

An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of digits.

Boolean act this way in the C programming language to avoid integer overflows in implicit narrowing conversions.

* Boolean type:
    * Keywords:
      * _Bool
    * Format Specifier:
      * %i
      * %d

### Day 16: January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Data types - Character

**Thoughts:** First, char is not a string, it represent a single character. Any character in the keyboard is a character. even a semicolon is a character. Character data uses single quotes. Example such as `'a'` or `'Z'` is a char data type. Basically any character in the keyboard is assigned with the ASCII code and it is an integer value.
 
Char declaration syntax is: `char variableName;`
 
After declaration you can assign a value to the variable. The assignment must be enclosed in single quotes.
 
Char initiation example: `variableName = 'A';`
 
When you don't give a single quote to the value, I think the compiler thinks that the value is the name of a variable hahaha. A double quotes is reserved for strings.

* Boolean type:
    * Keywords:
      * char
    * Format Specifier:
      * %c

### Day 17: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Data types - Octal

**Thoughts:** Octal is a number system base-8 that uses the digits 0 to 7. Octal numerals can be made from binary numerals.

Any integer constant that is prefixed with a zero are considered as octal constant by the C compiler. The compiler will return the corresponding value of the octal number provided when the variable is called.
 
Instead of providing a format specifier of an integer, there is a special format specifier of the octal value which is the `%o` that will not convert the value of the variable but it will act as it is an actual octal number.

You can also initialize a variable starting with a zero to be converted to a octal value such as `int var = 015`

### Day 18: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Data types - hexadecimal

**Thoughts:** a positional system that represents numbers using a base of 16. it uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols "0"–"9" and "A"–"F" (or alternatively "a"–"f") = 16 numbers. The prefix `0x` is used in C programming language.

There is a format specifier to the Hexadecimal and that is the `%x`. It is used to convert the content of the variable into the equivalent hexadecimal value.

You can also initialize a variable starting with a zero x to be converted to a hexadecimal value such as `int var = 0x15`

### Day 19: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Data Types - Enumeration

**Thoughts:** This is Awesomeness in one word. That is it. goodbye.
 
Enum, I think is short for (Enumerate) is basically a customized variable that accept custom data types that you create. To put it in words, Enum allow you to define a variable and specify valid values that can be stored in it.
 
Steps to create an Enum: I know sound like a sandwich :3 num, num num.
 
1. Initiate the keyword by `enum`
2. Name of the Enum data type
3. Enclosed in curly braces, the values that can be assigned to the type
 
Syntax:
 
`enum enumName {value1, value2, value3};`
 
Then you can use this sandwich oh! I mean you can declare a variable to be of the type enum you created.
 
Ok enough joking.
 
Enum is enumeration identifiers and the compiler treat them as integer constants. The first name in the list has a value of 0 and the second will have a value of 1 and so on..
 
You can assign a custom value to associate it with an enumeration identifier. You can do this when the data is defined. however if you did this, the next value in line will have the next number by incrementing the previous given number.
 
like this: `enum enumName {value1, value2 = 10, value3};`
 
After the initiation of an enum, you can declare a variable to be of type enum:
 
1. use the keyword enum
2. followed by the enumerated type name
3. followed by the variable list, so the statement
 
Syntax:
 
`enum enumName enumType1, enumType2;`

### Day 20: January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Data Types - Conversion

**Thoughts:** Data casting is about data conversion. It is a way to do an explicit conversion. I don't recommend it because it is easy to avoid it by writing a clear code with automatic type conversion.
 
Another thing to keep in mind is that each data type has a size value. Some bigger than the others. Here I will point out the data types arranged from the smallest to the biggest precedence and value.
 
Operator Precedence:
 
1. char
2. int
3. long
4. float
5. double
6. long double
7. casting operator !
 
Anyway, Operator Precedence is a whole topic on its own. I won't write everything in my mind about it here, it may take the whole day. If I find the chance I may get into it at another time.
 
In short what this means is, a mathematical operation between a long and int will always result to a value of long. Sometimes if you want to get a correct answer, you may need to convert the data into the right type.
 
One way to convert a data type is by using the casting technique. You can do this by proceeding the quantity with the name of the desired type in  parentheses. Both the parentheses and the type name is called a "Cast Operator".
 
To check the size in bytes that are in the memory makes use of the `sizeof` operator. It is also a keyword in the C programming language. To do this, just use the keyword and pass on the data you want to deal with. The data can be anything from data type, variables or names.

### Day 21: January 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Operators - Assignment 

**Thoughts:** The core functionality of an assignment operator is to assign a value of the expression from one side to the other. In the case of the C programming language, it assign the expression on the left to its variable at the left.
 
| Operator | Description              |
|----------|--------------------------|
| =        | Assign                   |
| +=       | Add then assign          |
| -=       | Subtract then assign     |
| *=       | Multiply then assign     |
| /=       | Divide then assign       |
| %=       | Get remainder then assign |
 
Notice that the value will be assigned the result value. This means that the variable will have a new value.

### Day 22: January 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Operators - Arithmetic

**Thoughts:** You can say that an arithmetic operator is a mathematical function that performs a calculation on two operands.
 
All the operators used as binary operators in case of arithmetic, this means that they need two operands. the addition and subtraction has some unary usage to increment and decrement.
 
| Operation | Description       |
|-----------|-------------------|
| +         | Addition          |
| -         | Subtraction       |
| *         | Multiplication    |
| /         | Division          |
| %         | Find the reminder |

### Day 23: January 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Operators - Increment & Decrement

**Thoughts:** Increment and decrement operators are unary operators that add or subtract one, to or from their operand, respectively. The increment operator increases, and the decrement operator decreases, the value of its operand by 1.

| Operation | Description       |
|-----------|-------------------|
| ++        | Increment value   |
| --        | Decrement value   |
 
Notice the increment and decrement are two kind, a postfix like (C++), mean the expression is going to be assigned after the statement. A prefix like (++C) will be assigned before the statement ends.

* The pre-fix operators increment or decrement their operand by 1, and the value of the expression is the resulting calculated value.
* The post-fix operators increment or decrement the value of their operand by 1, but the value of the expression is the operand's original value prior to the calculated operation.

### Day 24: January 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Operators - Relational

**Thoughts:** A comparison operator. It is used to compare values against each other.
 
| Operator | Description              |
|----------|--------------------------|
| ==       | Equals                   |
| !=       | Not equals               |
| <        | Less than                |
| >        | Greater than             |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to |
 
Usually comparison deal with the boolean operator and will output a 0 or 1 as in true or false.

### Day 25: January 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Operators - Logical

**Thoughts:** You can say that a logical operator is an operator that will give or return one to two expressions. As in boolean true and false. It is also called a Boolean operator.
 
| Operator | Description               |
|----------|---------------------------|
| &&       | Represent the logical AND |
| ||       | Represent the logical OR  |
| !        | Represent the logical NOT |
 
AND is true if both operands are equal or both operands are not equal.
 
OR is true if one of the operands are true and only false if both operands are false.
 
NOT is just the reverse of the operand. if it is true then it will be false. if it is false then it will be true.

### Day 26: January 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Operators - Bitwise

**Thoughts:** This is more of an advanced thing than just to get going. A bitwise work with bits in integer values. Usually a binary number of zero and one, where the number can be as long as you want. I can say it is not used in normal programs unless you want to store a really big data maybe! Bitwise operators look similar to logical operators but they are a single sign instead of a double sign.
 
I personally understand binary numbers and deal with them from an early age so it is clear to me. But I will try to put it into words or points for if someone would like to refer to it, or just for the reader.
 
* A binary number means two numbers (if you notice the "bi" before the number). 
* The two numbers are zero and one.
* Every binary number has a corresponding decimal value
* The position of the Binary number corresponds to its value.
    * each position has a value
    * each digit, multiply the digit by its position value. You can say that you are rising the number to the power of two mathematically
    * The sum of all the numbers are the final result
 
Example:
* 1 Binary = 1 Decimal
* 10 Binary = 2 Decimal
* 100 Binary = 4 Decimal
* 1000 Binary = 8 Decimal
* 10000 Binary = 16 Decimal
* 100000 Binary = 32 Decimal
* 1000000 Binary = 64 Decimal
* 10000000 Binary = 128 Decimal
* 10000010 Binary = 130 Decimal
 
And so on.. .
 
A bit is a measurement of data, a byte equal to eight bits. As you can see how much control you have over the data if you can turn on and off each one of these bits. Yeah, they say the human brain can do better than this, It is possible hahaha.
 
It has its usage sometimes, I really like it. an example would be to use a single integer variable to store multiple characteristics of an individual. for example, you can store nice and cool in one bit.
 
In just bits you can have very big data stored in small space.
 
Bitwise Operators:

| Operator | Description                     |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| &        | Binary logical AND              |
| |        | Binary logical OR for bitwise   |
| ^        | Binary logical XOR              |
| ~        | Binary complement, Logical NOT  |
| <<       | Binary left shift               |
| >>       | Binary right shift              |
 
XOR `^` logical operator will only evaluate as true if both operands are opposite of each other. It will evaluate to false only if both operands are the same.
 
You can say it is a "Binary Left shift" when the left operand value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand. Example : `X<<2 = 240 i.e. 111 000`
 
You can say it is a "Binary Right Shift" when the left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand. Example : `Y>>2 = 15 i.e. 0000 1111`
 
Shifting can lead to losing bits of you moved too much to the edge and fall off. I find this very funny.
 
Bitwise also has Assignment operators:
 
| Operator | Description                      |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| &=       | Bitwise AND then assign          |
| |=       | Bitwise inclusive OR then assign |
| ^=       | Bitwise exclusive OR then assign |
| <<=      | Left shift then assign           |
| >>=      | Right shift then assign          |

### Day 27: January 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Control flow - Basics

**Thoughts:** Control flow statements gives logical condition to the program to have a choice. An easy way to give logic to the program is to use logical operators in such way to create a condition that will change the flow.

Most statements in the C programming language is an expression. A combination of operators and operands is called an expression.

Some of the Statements types:

* Declaration statements
* Assignment statement
* Conditional statement
* Function call statement
* Logical statement
* Structure statement
* Return statement
* Compound statement or grouped statements

And many more statements.. .

### Day 28: January 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Control Flow - Ternary Statement

**Thoughts:** It is a unique way to control the flow of a program using sign and a mark to give the condition and the statements that are to be executed. In the C programming language it is useualy used in assignments.

Like other programming languages the ternaary takes, "As the name suggest" three operands. Seperated by a question mark and a colon.

_Steps_:

1. First operand
2. Question mark
3. Second operand
4. Colon
5. Third operand

Syntax: `condition ? firstExpression : secondExpression;`

### Day 29: January 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** If Statement

**Thoughts:** Generally programs are executed by sequence, step by step until it is done. It is boring, so control flow came along and introduced an idea of, "You know what? I can take another flow if it seem logical. A CHOICE!". Well, still following orders but atleast now programs seem like they can make a choice or loop around etc...

Desision making require a condition to work. And giving conditions can be written using a condition statement. There are also types of condition statemsnts.

If statement is giving the program another choice of execution. It's  an intersting functionality because it give the feeling that the computer is capable of thinking.

Syntax:

```
if (condition) {
  statement;
}
```

**Today's Progress:** If Else Statement
 
**Thoughts:** Simple If statement have one condition, if you want to have more than one condition you have to utilize the else statement.
 
Like if the condition didn't work something else will happen.

```
if (condition) {
  statement;
}
else {
  statement;
}

**Today's Progress:** Nested If/ If Else 
 
**Thoughts:** The else if statement is when you want to have multiple conditions. It functions as the if statement but with more than one condition.
 
This else if statement still need to end with an else statement.
 
Syntax:
 
```
if (condition) {
  statement;
}
else if (condition2) {
  statement;

### Day 32: February 1, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Control Flow - Nested If Else Statement
 
**Thoughts:** Nesting is not recommended because the code can lose clarity. but it has its uses.
 
Nested conditionals can be parsed in multiple ways. Adding multiple nesting level is complicating the job for some compilers, so let us be careful.
 
Syntax:
 
```
if (condition) {
  statement;
}
else if (condition2) {
    if (nestedCondition) {
    statement;
  }
  else {
    condition;

### Day 33: February 2, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Control Flow - Switch Statement
 
**Thoughts:** An easier way to write a program that has a condition to choose between two alternatives. It is advisable to use switch statement only when the comparison condition is on the value.
 
Rules:
 
1. the condition or expression is going to be compared with all the statements
2. cases must be constant or constant expression
3. the break statement point the end of a condition
4. default is what is going to be executed if nothing works.
 
Syntax:
 
```
switch (expression)
{
  case firstValue:
    statement;
    break;
  case secondStatement:
    statement;
    break
  case secondStatement:

### Day 34: February 3, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Control Flow - For Loop
 
**Thoughts:** The idea of executing a block of code over and over again is called looping in programming. There are a finite loops and infinite loops, you can guess what you need.
 
Still a sequential execution but with some sugar, I mean sequential mini cupcakes, ah enough joking*. I mean small sequential statements that control the flow of the program.
 
Loops are simple, they have two points:
 
  1. Condition
      * true or false
  2. Conditional Code
      * do something on each condition
 
For loops are controlled loops that you can define variables and manage them to have a custom output.
 
For loop syntax can be broken down into a set of expressions and a block of code.
 
```
for (expression1 ; expression2 ; expression3)
{
  The block of code
}
```
 
* Expression1, usually run once at the start, and it is usually to declare a variable that is used by the loop.
* Expression2 is the condition where the loop is going to stop
* Expression3 is what happen to the variable declared
 
Loops can be written differently but this is the most common way to write a for loop.
 
Note: You can create an infinite loop by just adding two semicolons:
 
```
for(;;) {
  statements
}
```

### Day 35: February 4, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Control Flow - While loop
 
**Thoughts:** The while loop tests the condition before executing the loop body, then it repeat statement while the condition is true.

A loop is a block of code that will repeat, and the number of times that a loop is repeated can be controlled. The loop is controlled with the condition provided.

Syntax:

```
while(expression){
  statement1;
  statement2;
}
```

The thing is you need to provide a condition for the loop to stop, and it is usually inside the loop block. Unless you don't want it to stop!

### Day 36: February 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Control Flow - Do While loop

**Thoughts:** This statement will run the code at least once before checking the condition, if the condition is true it will run the code again. If the condition is not true, then the loop will end with one execution.

This loop has its condition at the end. This means that the statement will run at least once.

Syntax:

```
do {
  statements
}
while (expression);

### Day 37: February 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Constants

**Thoughts:** A constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution. When you don't want the value to change of a predefined named container, you can create a constant. And a constant must be defined, similar to the include command, It starts with a hashtag. A constant is a type of identifier.

Syntax: ` #define NAME value`

Yes there is no equal sign. But be careful using the define because it is an instruction to the preprocessor. Keep in mind that this way a constant can be redefined and reassigned a value later on in the program.

The correct way to define a constant is to use the keyword `_CONST` with the name of the constant. It is also called a "True Constant".

Syntax: `#define NAME_CONST value`

This way you can reassign a value to it. A true constant indeed.

### Day 38: February 7, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Arrays - Declaration
 
**Thoughts:** Arrays are a named storage of specified data type that are stored in sequence.
 
Declaring an array is similar to variable declarations. The difference is how to contain the multiple data, and they are contained in a square brackets `[ ]`. In C, there isn't a thing that is called multiple data types array.
 
You need a number between the square brackets to represent the number of data that can be stored in it. Once you declare the array with a size, you can't change the size of it.
 
Syntax: `typeSpecifier arrayName[size];`

### Day 39: February 8, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Arrays - Initialization
 
**Thoughts:** Initializing an array is assigning initial values for the array. The values in an array are called elements.
 
Initializing arrays in C is by assigning a list of the elements to store inside. The list is enclosed in curly brackets and separated by commas.
 
If you didn't specify a value to all the elements in the array, the remaining values will be zero.
 
Syntax: `typeSpecifier arrayName[size] = {data1, data2, data3};`

### Day 40: February 9, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Arrays - Designated Initialization
 
**Thoughts:** Designated initialization of an array means that you can set the value of each element by assigning it to its index position.
 
This feature gives you the ability to initialize the array in any order.
 
Syntax: `arrayName[size] = {[2] = 200, [0] = 1000};`
 
The square brackets hold the number of the element, then you can assign a value to it.
 
I read that the feature is used in C99 standard and then dropped on C11 onward.

### Day 41: February 10, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Arrays - Designated Assignment
 
**Thoughts:** Designated assignment means that you can change or assign a value to the element, not necessary at the initialization state.
 
This is also known as array mutation. Arrays at the core are variables that hold multiple values, therefore array can change their values and so array can do the same function of changing their elements values.
 
You can do this by targeting the element position and assign a new value to it. The targeting can happen with the square bracket notation.

### Day 42: February 11, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Multidimensional Arrays
 
**Thoughts:** Declaring a multidimensional array is similar to the single dimension array. The difference is that now you need two square brackets to assign the size.
 
Syntax: `typeSPecifier arrayName[NumberOfDimension][elementsInsideEachDimension];`
 
Where in matix:
 
* NumberOfDimension represent the rows
* elementsInsideEachDimension represent the columns
 
Initializing a multidimensional array is similar to a single dimension array. The difference is that each dimension will have its own curly braces separated by commas.
 
You can also initialize elements in any order if you wish to use a designated initializer.
 
You can have any number of dimensions following the same method.

**Today's Progress:** Arrays - Accessing an Array Element

**Thoughts:** Arrays are based zero. This means the index number of the first element in the array is zero.

Every data in the array can be accessed from the array by the same key name (array name).

Remember the size of the array must be greater than zero. you can use an expression to determine the value of the size, but you can't use a negative value.

Syntax: `arrayName[indexNumber];`

### Day 45: February 14, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Arrays - Iteration through Array Elements
 
**Thoughts:** It makes sense now, but before I learn about all the things in the array, I would be confused.
 
Iteration is when you want to run through the array using all the elements stored inside it or some of them, depending on the condition.
 
I achieved this using a control flow functionality that loop through all the elements, and then print them out.

### Day 46: February 15, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** The Break Statement
 
**Thoughts:** The break statement is used with conditionals to break out of a loop. You can say it will change the flow of the condition so it will evaluate to false instead of continue being true.
 
It is useful in a loop that will keep running unless you break out of it.

### Day 47: February 16, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** The Continue Statement
 
**Thoughts:** At first, I thought of the continue statement as the same as the break statement. But after a few tries, I found out that it is different.
 
Continue statement will break the loop only for a moment. Like a small stop then continue running the loop. You can say it is a temporary stop.

### Day 48: February 17, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Functions - Basics and CLA
 
**Thoughts:** Functions are controllable block of code. THe idea came when computer scientists didn't want to repeat typing the code for a functionality that already exist. It also reduces the complexity of the overall program. It does this by breaking down the program into functions rather than one whole page of code.
 
`main()` is the main function of any C program. main is a keyword that is reserved for this cause. This function is where the program starts execution.
 
Command line arguments (CLA) are a method to pass data into the program. It is another way to supply the data to the program when it runs.
 
The main function is the first thing that the C program is going to run. When the system run the program, two command line arguments are passed in it:
 
* `argc` 
    * It is an integer value that specifies the number of arguments passed in. You can say it is for argument count. To count how many things are passing in.
* `*argv` 
    * Is the string, or more accurately in C, it is an array of character pointers. This "argv" is for argument vector.
 
Both `argc` and `*argv` will tell the function how to pass data into it.
 
There is this thing with the asterisks `*` and it has a connection with strings which I will get into them at a later day.

### Day 49: February 18, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Functions - Definitions
 
**Thoughts:** Function in the C programming language is similar to other programming languages. A block of code that can accomplish a specific task. It also saves time by reducing the duplication of code.
 
The difference is that when you create a function in the C programming language, You need to specify the function header as the first line of the function definition.
 
The syntax is similar to the main function:
1. function head
    * Specify the type of the value this function returns
    * Define the name of the function
    * Can accommodate parameters = arguments
2. function body
    * Enclosed with curly braces `{}`
    * The code
 
```
returnType functionName( parameter1, parameter2, . ..)
{
  functionBody
}
```
 
_Note_: Meaningful function name enhance the readability of the program.
 
It is advisable when defining a function without body by using the type `void`. It will tell that this function will do nothing. There are some implementations for this at the testing level of development.

### Day 50: February 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Functions - Declaration

**Thoughts:** If you find yourself that you want to do a specific thing multiple times in a program, this is the time to use a function. Writing the program as functions is called modularizing the program. As the functions are modules inside the program.

Defining a function is not declaring it. The two processes are separated because you can't use a function before it is declared. If you did use a function before it is declared, the compiler will print out an error.

A function declaration is a must if you want to use the function before it's defined.

To declare a function in the C programming language, you will use something called function prototypes. Function prototypes is a statement that give information about the function such as name and type.

_Function Prototype are_:

    1. placed at the beginning of the source code
    2. allow you to call the function anywhere from the program

_Good points_:  

  * Good practice
  * Consistent in design
  * Prevent errors on global calls

Syntax: `functionType functionName();`

Notice the simi-colon at the end.
 
Header files that are included at the beginning of the program is actually a file that adds the function prototype for that library. Interesting.

### Day 51: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Functions - Parameters

**Thoughts:** Parameters are usually defined at the function header after the function name and within parentheses separated by commas. These parameters are treated as local variables to the function.

* Parameter is a placeholder for arguments.
* Argument is the data that are passed into the function parameters
* Functions with no parameters can have `void` or nothing passed in them. 

_Note_:

* `void` means no data.
* Arguments that are specified at the call of a function must agree in type, number and sequence with the parameters in the function header.

### Day 52: February 21, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Functions - Return
 
**Thoughts:** Return in function is the result of all the calculation that happen, or as they say, the butter!
 
The return type is responsible for the type of data that function is going to return, the type must be specified. The result will depend on the type. If you wish to not return a value then you must set the type to void.
 
Returning data from a function happen at the return statement. The return statement is also the call to end the function and produce a result of the calculation.
 
_Syntax_: `return thingToReturn;`

### Day 53: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Functions - Call

**Thoughts:** Function call is about running the function and assigning data to return. It has usage when you want to substitute one of the operands to the returned value of the function.

Function call is independent in its nature and will not mix its function with the other calculations that happen after the function has produced the result. This will give the advantage of using the returned value. In the end, it is up to you if you want to use the data that are returned from function calls.

_Syntax_: `my_finction_call();`

### Day 54: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Functions - Scope

**Thoughts:** THe idea of scope comes from the limitation. THe limit of that function. There can be two scopes (limits) on how a variable can affect the program.

In functions, global variables are a bad thing to do because of the dependencies. It will be hard to find bugs in the program and even harder to fix because dependencies. This is why it is much better to use local variables when it comes to functions.

1. Global Scope

The value of the global variable can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

Functions in a program is a self contained block of code that has its own world, but this world is also inside the program and the program can be expressed here as the globe. If there is a global variable in the program, it can affect the local variable inside the function too.

The problem is that variables are susceptible to mutation and any function (local) can change the value stored in them. This may result in unwanted effects, especially when it affects many locals.

2. Local Scope

The value of a local variable can only be accessed inside the code block that is created in.

The idea of a code block is to encapsulate small chunk of code in one place and independant to other codes in the program. any variables that are inside the block of code must do the job of not changing codes outside the block. In programming, we call this "Local thing"

Global variable will always be available to the local functions. And a local variable will overwrite a global variable if they have the same name.

### Day 55: February 24, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Functions - Practice & Review
 
**Thoughts:** I had to review my knowledge about functions and to do this I created C program to perform basic arithmetic operations with the user input.
 
I can see how things work now. I have a better understanding on how the computer call and uses the data.

### Day 56: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Strings - Declaration

**Thoughts:** There is no string type in the C programming language. I was shocked and excited at the same time, It is like something has ticked on my mind that said, "If there isn't a string type, then CREATE ONE!".

A language that has this level of control can easily create a string type to be used. The language itself has no operators for processing strings but, strings are just a collection of characters stored in sequence.

Using the character data type with the array functionality will have a similar effect of a string. In more details, the characters in a string will be stored in memory cells that follow each others.

To declare a string, define an array with type char and the size required to hold the string.

_Syntax_: `char stringName[size];`

The size of the array will always be one less than what is specified because every array will have a `null` character at the end of it.

### Day 57: February 26, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Strings - Initialization
 
**Thoughts:** There are two ways to initialize a string. Since it is an array after all.
 
_The first method_: is when you declare the string. Just like any other array type, you assign the characters in the index by sequence
 
_Syntax_: `char stringName[size] = {'firstLetter', 'secondLetter', 'and so on..'};`
 
The size is important to keep it right but, if you did not assign a specific size, the compiler will determine the size automatically. It will do so my counting the elements in the array. It will also automatically add a space for the null terminator.
 
Notice the single quotes to assign the characters in the first method.
 
_The second method_: is to use a double quotes to assign the string.
 
_Syntax_: `char stringName[size] = {"TheString"};`
 
Remember: 
 
* single quotes is a basic character
* double quotes is an array of character and null terminated.

### Day 58: February 27, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Strings - Reassigning value to strings
 
**Thoughts:** A string is an array of character. since it is an array, we can use all sorts of things that work on arrays. we can see how long the array is and even assign data to it.
 
If we want to reassign the characters in the string, we just have to know the index of the character we want to reassign, and then assign a new value to it.
 
_Syntax_: `stringName[indexNumber] = 'newCharacter';`
 
however this is good to change one or two character at the most but, for a whole set of strings, this method will be very repetitive.
 
There is a built-in function that does this with ease. and it is called `strncpy()`

### Day 59: February 28, 2020
 
**Today's Progress:** Strings - Display & Input type specifier
 
**Thoughts:** Strings are a bit more complicated than a primitive data type in the C programming language. Yes this means that strings are not a primitive data type, the are more of a constructive data type now.
 
The string data type need to be an array of character and null terminated. The last character need to be null.
 
To display the string in a pre-defined function `printf()` you need to call the string by its name, similar to variables. and the format specifier is `%s` which only output a string that is a null terminated.
 
To input a string, you don't need the `&` sign to use the address operator on the string. The `%s` is enough to input the string. because something that deals with pointers, which I will get into later on.
 
Note: Don't have space on the inputted string because anything after the space will be ignored.
