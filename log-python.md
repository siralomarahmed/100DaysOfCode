# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Ahmed A. M. Alomar

## Pyhton Programming Language

Designed by	Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Inspired from the SETL high-level programming language and became as a successor to the ABC general-purpose programming language. The idea of python started from the 1980 with its first implementation in 1989, basically it toke ten years to have its first appearance in the 1990.

The main features of Python is that it is designed for code readability.

Python Programming language is:

  1. High-level. A programming langauge with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.
  2. Interpreted. Programming language type that execute instructions directly without compiling into machine-language-instruction.
  3. Dynamically typed. It has the ability to execute many common programming behaviours at runtime.
  4. Garbage-collected. It has automatic memory management.
  5. General-purpose. A computer language that is broadly applicable across application domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain.
  6. Batteries included. A language that has comprehensive standard library.
  7. programming-language. A formal language that consist of a set of instructions that produce an output.

Python Programming paradigms:

  1. Structured. Has extensive use of structured control flow constructs.
  2. Procedural. Contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.
  3. Object-Oriented. Builds objects of data that can interact and mutate one another.
  4. Functional. Building the structure of computer programs from mathematical expressions and avoids data mutablity.

*Main Commitment*:

I will learn and code in the **Python** programming language for at least an hour a day for 100 days.

The standard version of the language I will use is Python 3.
