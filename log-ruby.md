### Day 1: September 18, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Installed Ruby on my computer and coded my first console app. I also learned two different ways to print data into the console screen. Using "puts" and "print".

**Thoughts:** The syntax is simple. and the output will be automatically defined as a string if it is enclosed in quotations.
I really struggled with installing ruby on my windows computer, It toke me more than an hour. But overall, I managed to install it and test run my "Hello World". If you are using windows, it is better to use ruby installer to get the installation faster.

If anyone want to get into ruby, start with the official site and you will find your way: [ruby-lang](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

### Day 2: September 19, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Learned the Basics of ruby String Methods.

**Thoughts:** As expected from an object orianted programming (OOP) methods are always present. the syntax is also very simple. By using the dot (.) after the string, you can apply a method into the string. Well, I learned about these methods today:
```ruby
 .upcase
 .downcase
 .capitalize
 .reverse
 .length
```

### Day 3: September 20, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basics of Variables in Ruby

**Thoughts:** Variables in ruby must start with lowercase letters. Because classes uses the capitalize naming convention.. well, I don't know about that, I will have to wait until I get into classes, well, ruby classes that is ^^/. Aside from that, I had fun creating variables in ruby today.

Ruby variables is also self declarative as you dont have to declare a string before you assign a string to a variable. I had to use some of yesterday string methods with the variables to make things much more intersting.

### Day 4: September 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned the basics of getting user input in Ruby

**Thoughts:** By using `gets` to get the user input, you can store the input into a seperate variable to use it later. for example, I use it to print it out on the console screen by using `puts`

----
### Day 5: September 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic String concatenation and interpolation.

**Thoughts:** I realized that `puts` and `gets` will give a newline in the putput. So, I make use of a new string method `.chomp`. this method will just chop off the new line givin after the `gets`.
So cool, I ended up simulating a comversation using what I learned so far.

----
### Day 6: September 23, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic Math Using Ruby

**Thoughts:** The basic math operation are similar to diffrent programming languages. In other hand numbers are treated a bit diffrently, as for numbers that are less than zero, you must write the zero on the left "0.5" or it will output an error. Also, numbers that are less than zero are float, and if you are dealing with floats, you need to input floats to output floats. Because ruby will assume you want an integer if you input an integer, not a float.

### Day 7: September 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic Numbers Strings Conversion

**Thoughts:** You can't add a number to a string in Ruby. It will print an error, "no implicit conversion of Integer to String (TypeError)". Because `gets` will get string, and `puts` will put a string. To convert the numbers, you can use the `.to_` method and specify the type of the number. For integer `.to_i` and for a float `.to_f` to convert.
I also learned that to convert a number to a string, you can use the `to_s` method.

### Day 8: September 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic Comparision Operators

**Thoughts:** I learned the basic 6 comparision operator and they are:

| Operator |   function               |
|----------|--------------------------|
|    ==    | Equal                    |
|    !=    | Not Equal                |
|    >     | Greater than             |
|    <     | Less than                |
|    <     | Greater than or equal to |
|    <     | Less than or equal to    |

The output of a comparision operator is going to be a booloian true or false.

### Day 9: September 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic Assignment Operators

**Thoughts:** assignment operatos are used to assign value to something. Just as in variable assignments. there are 7 aassignment operators in Ruby and they are:

| Operator |   function                             |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
|     =    | Assign the right side to the left side |
|    +=    | add and assign                         |
|    -=    | subtract and assign                    |
|    *=    | multiply and assign                    |
|   **=    | exponent then assign                   |
|    /=    | Divide then assign                     |
|    %=    | Modulus then assign                    |

### Day 10: September 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** If - Conditional Statement

**Thoughts:** Conditional statements let us use conditional operators and then do something based on the condition. the syntax of the if statement is very simple. At first I thought it wont work haha XD, But it actually worked and I realy like it.

### Day 11: September 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Conditional Statement - if else & elsif

**Thoughts:** This type of conditional statement is very useful to make a multiple If statements in one block of code. I wonder why Ruby made the "else if" into a "elsif" ! like I would rather type the "elseif" rather than the "elsif", It is just one letter diffreance.

### Day 12: September 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic Arrays in Ruby

**Thoughts:** I see you can create an array just like variables, and enclose them in a square brackets. By creating arrays, you can then call them as a list. it is better than using `puts` several times to print a list of names. Arrays can hold numbers, strings or another arrays.

### Day 13: September 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic Arrays Interactions in Ruby

**Thoughts:** You can access a specific data in the array by calling it according to its index number. `array_name[index_Number]`.
You can use methods on the array as the `.length` method to get the lenth of the array according to how maney items inside it. You can utilize the method to get other things if you combine it with a bit of math, like getting the last item in the array.

### Day 14: October 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic Arrays and the Multidimensional Arrays in Ruby

**Thoughts:** Multidimensional Arrays means an array inside of an array. Basically a nested arrays. You can retreve data from the demensions of the array by utilizing the index positions.

### Day 15: October 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic Loops in Ruby - While Loop

**Thoughts:** Just like the if statement, but instead with an "if" you write "while". One IMPORTANT thing.. . Dont do infinite loop hahaha. Make sure you have a condition so that your loop is going to end.
basically the syntax of the while loop is this:
```Ruby
while CONDITION
  DO SOMETHING
end
```

### Day 16: October 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic Loops in Ruby - Each Loop

**Thoughts:** This loop is totaly new to me. It is the most object orianted loop. You use it by calling "each" as a method on a range. It is very useful loop, you can iterate through an array or run a condition a cople of times. the syntax is simple too:
```Ruby
(CONDITION).each DO SOMETHING
end 
```

### Day 17: October 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Hashes in Ruby

**Thoughts:** Hashes are a little bit like an array, but the diffrence is that hashes take the approach of "key, value" pair. as an object. Another thing is that the index will be the key, and its value will be... it's value, hahaha.
Hashes are useful for more complex data. As in a database, you can pull multiple things from there.

### Day 18: October 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Ruby Basic about Methods!

**Thoughts:** I thought methods are just methods, but in Ruby, methods are actually a mechanisim that represent a function. Because functions need to be defined to be used later. a function is like a variable but it does a lot more.

### Day 19: October 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** More on Ruby Methods

**Thoughts:** Methods can have more than one parameter. So it is a function =-=\ Fine, I will call it a method just because *Ruby*. :) so, methods can also return values and be stored in a variables to be used later in the program.

### Day 20: October 7, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basics of Classes in Ruby - part 1

**Thoughts:** A class is like a factory. It take an input, do something with it and then puts out an output. 
Today I practiced class declarations. Classes use a capitalized name. I think I am getting used to the syntax now, because classes look like Methods at a first glimps. The name of the class will become initilized and assigned into a global constant.

I think I am going to spend some days understanding the Ruby class. It is a bit challenging so, breaking the topic down into smaller parts to fully understand it.

### Day 21: October 8, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basics of Classes in Ruby - part 2

**Thoughts:** classes are made up of a bunch of methods. and the first method is "initilize". initilize will have a parameter. where you can do stuff to it.. .

The steps I learned to create class in ruby so far:
1. Class declaration
2. Class initilization

### Day 22: October 9, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basics of Classes in Ruby - part 3

**Thoughts:** Classes methods do not use normal variables, The use instance variables. An instance variable has a name beginning with "@". Those type of variables cannot be altered or even observed, and it has a much narrow scope in the program, 

The steps I learned to create class in ruby so far:
1. Class declaration
2. Class initilization
3. Class variables and jobs!

### Day 23: October 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basics of Classes in Ruby - part 4

**Thoughts:** To run the class, You need to turn the class on. and you do that by calling the `.new` method and not the initialize method.. I know it is weird, but this is how Ruby do it. What this will do is, Creating a new instance of our class. I also learned about the `.inspect` method to inspect things.

The steps I learned to create class in ruby so far:
1. Class declaration
2. Class initilization
3. Class variables and jobs!
4. Inspect some information about the class..

### Day 24: October 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basics of Classes in Ruby - part 5

**Thoughts:** Today I learned how to get something out of a class in Ruby. It is called a getter. Getter is a method where usually will be named as the instance variable in the initialize method, and this method will return something that you can call to the output.

The steps I learned to create class in ruby so far:
1. Class declaration
2. Class initilization
3. Class variables and jobs!
4. Inspect some information about the class..
5. Use Getter with class

### Day 25: October 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basics of Classes in Ruby - part 6

**Thoughts:** Today I learned about setters. and it is how to set something or change something from the class. Remember, you cant have two methods with the exact name, you may get an error.

My knowledge of Ruby class now is:
* A class will include three main methods
  1. Initilaize method
  2. Getter method
  3. Setter method

### Day 27: October 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Making a useful class with Ruby

**Thoughts:** Today I simulate how to calculate the perimeter of a square using a class in ruby. I learned how to output all the methods that has been declared in the class in one line, wchich is better than outputting them one by one. I have to say writting the getters and setters are a long way to go. Tomorrow I want to find a way to make the code more clear.

### Day 28: October 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:** The useful lovely Class Attr Accessor <3

**Thoughts:** This is a blessing, from having to type the getters and the setters. Just use class atter, and you are done. I have to say this is very satisfying. I rewrite the Square class of yesterday useing class attr.

In the adventure of learning classes in Ruby, make sure you know:
1. attr_reader   => this one will create the getter
2. attr_writter  => this one will create the setter
3. attr_accessor => This one will create both the getter and setter !

and the accessor is the best <3

### Day 30: October 17, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Intermediate practice on printing in Ruby

**Thoughts:** Using `puts` and `print` is good, but you know me, I like to get into the rabbit hole and here we go, I am learning another way.. and it is by using the `p`. The `p` method will offer an accurate way of the type of the data. the `p` method will also interpret the input like it is a code. for example, a new line will be written as `\n` instead of just outputting a newline. A more discriptive way to view things.
`puts` always print out a newline even if there is nothing in it. So I make use of it to output the code in a visible manner. Also `puts` can have multiple lines string and it will take the new lines as, new lines!.

### Day 31: October 18, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Deep dive into Variables

**Thoughts:** Today I just enhanced my knowledge with Variables. As for now, I know that:


* A variable is a reference to an object
* That object is a subject to change. 
* They are called pointers or identifiers 
* Where the variable itself is not an object 
* The variable itself is a placeholder for an object
* And because Ruby is dynamically typed, variables types do not have to be declared.
* The same variable can be reassigned to an object of another data type.


Variable Syntax:
1. Variables are pointed to an object with the equal sign (=)
2. The right side of the equal sign is always evaluated first
3. Variable names should start with a lowercase letter or underscore
4. Spaces are not allowed. Use underscores instead. It is also called (lower_snake_case)

**Today's Progress:** Ruby Constants

**Thoughts:** Ruby Constants operate like a variable. The idea is about something that will not change over time. So a constant variable is a variable that will not change over time.

Even so, Ruby allow this constant to be changed. because Ruby is very flexable language. However this is not recommended.

Rules:
* name the constant in a capitalized way
* It is better if you write it all in caps (uppercase)

### Day 38: October 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Intermediate Numbers and the ".class" Method

**Thoughts:** I wanted to get a strong foundation of the language itself before diving more deep.   

Everything in Ruby is an object. And objects has method. for every number, they have a method called `.next` and it will get the next number.   

These objects come from a blueprint, and the word that describe the blueprint is "class".  

A class is just the template of each object that is created from it. It is not the actual thing itself, it is more of a guide line of how the thing will be built.

Every object in Ruby has an object that they share, and it is the "class" method. You can use the `.class` method to get what blueprint that object is made of.

**Thoughts:** the methods `.to_i`. `.to_f` and `.to_s` are available even if the object is that data type. And the result will be the exact same thing. Float conversion is a bit deffrent, because when you convert float to string for example, the method will ignore the numbers after the decimal point and bring back the whole number.

**Thoughts:** Boolean object is just true and false. it can only be either one of them. Booleans are objects too. each boolean has a diffrent class. as `true` is from the class TrueClass and `false` is from the FalseClass.

You can use the `.odd?` and `.even?` object method to get a boolean value. It is useful in combination with numbers. Just remember, these odd and even method is not available on the float numbers.

### Day 43: October 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic Float Methods in Ruby

**Thoughts:** Because converting the float number to an integer using the `.to_i` will chop off the numbers after the decimal, there are other solutions to keep those values. Methods like the `.floor` will round the float number down to a whole number. In other hand the `.ceil` will round up to the nearist integer.

Here is an intersting method, `.round`. this method can take a parameter. and that parameter can chose how many numbers after the decimal you would like to round to.

`.abs` absolute value, as in math this method will always return a positive number.

### Day 44: October 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic of Blocks in Ruby - part 1

**Thoughts:** A Ruby block is a group collection of Ruby statements that imediately follows a method call. Blocks are not methods. It will give an instruction for the method on how it should work in a specific condition. So, a block cannot exist except within the context of a method. It add a bit more clearity when a method require more details.

You can make a Ruby block after calling a method on an object by using the "{}" curley braceses. And what is inside of the braceses will be the block of instruction. This is called a one line block.

Blocks can include something called block variable. and this block variable has a local scope only inside the block of code. the syntax is two virtical pipes "||". What the function of the variable or variables that are inside will depend on what is the method you are calling the block of code on.

You cant use single qoutes and a new line escape character. they dont work in Ruby. Single qoutes  also litterally interpret what is between them ignoring the escape and template literal commands.

### Day 50: November 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Strings comparision and concatenation

**Thoughts:** In the Ruby algorithem, the capital letters come before the lowercase letters, this mean that capital letters has a lower number value than the lowercase letters. Strings are case sinsitive in comparision, They have to match in order to be the same.

In Ruby there is alot of ways to concat strings together. 
1. Using the plus sign `+`
2. Using short-hand syntax `+=`
3. Using the shovel operator `<<`
4. Using A Method

The `.concat()` method will permenentaly modify the variable, this mean it will overwrite the variable. The `.prepend()` method will do the reverse of concat, it will also overwrite the variable.

You can also mosh up methods together to create an intersting output, for example. getting the length of a string by using the `.length` method and then using the `.even?` method to get an output as a boolean object.

**Today's Progress:** Extract a character from string.

**Thoughts:** Strings in Ruby are changable. and they are counted by the index number which starts from zero. By using the "[]" square cracet notation, you can call the index number as a method from the string. This mean that string is going to be like an object and the calling of the index number is going to act like the method. A presentation of how object orianted programming work.

You can use the `.slice()` method, which is identical to the square bracket to call a character from a string.

This is how you get multiple character from a string. You can also use the `.slice()` method giving it two parameter, the first is for the index number where you want to start, and the second is to how maney characters.

If you used an index number that is nore than the length of the character, the method will print the string and ignore the rest.

Remember: the two dots method will include the range to index number with it, the three dots method will not include the range to index number with it.

### Day 57: November 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** The Bang Method in Ruby

**Thoughts:** When you use a method on a string, a new string will be created and the old one will be reserved in the memory. It is more like a temporary creation. Because the old string, before the alteration will still be available. You can try this by assigning a string to a variable and then using a method on it.

If you want to modify it, You can assign the string again. This way is ok, but a bit confusing. You can do the same thing by using the Bang method... " ! " this bang... . However. The bang method will mutate the origional string. The obvious advantage is that it has a clean syntax, which is easier to read.

The bang " ! " method is not a sign, it is actually a specific method, as in `reverse!` and it only work on few methods. So, it is not an extra operational sign you attach it to any method.

`.empty?` this method will only return yes if the string is empty and nothing inside it. If it has anything inside it, it will return false. it will simply see if the string length is equal to zero. `.nil?` method does exactly the same thing. You use this method when you want to check about an object that represent nothingness.

**Today's Progress:** Advance Method in Ruby part 1

**Thoughts:** I wonder, why do they call it a method, when it is a conditional statements?... . It is about writing the method to solve a solution over and over again everytime the problem come along.

* A method is a grouped collection of Ruby statements that serves a purpose.
* Methods are designed to be reused. Follow the golden rule: DRY
  - D = Dont
  - R = Repete
  - Y = Yourself
* Methods abstract the complexity of solving a problem.
* A method is first defined with a set of Ruby statements
* The method is then called or invoked. These are programming terms for "run" or "executed".

Variables that are declared inside the method will only have scope inside the method, and will not affect variables on the global scope.

Every methid will return a final value. The returned value is the output. There are two ways to return a value. explicit and implicit. Use explicit return if you want to return a value from a method early, incase you dont need to execute the whole method to the end.

**Today's Progress:** Advance Conditionals with Methods in Ruby part 1

**Thoughts:** if statement, can use conditions to execute. They can include methods and other mathimatical equations. the if statement can evaluate its condition to truthiness and falsiness as a boolean condition. Remember, that everything is truthly value in Ruby except false and nil.

"if elsif statement" is used to not repeat "if statements" You can combine multiple "if statements" to be more specific on your output.

"if elsif else statement" the last else here is a last catch for whatever happens that is outside the conditions you have stated before.

* Programming is about defining the paths that a program can take
* conditional is a statement that controls if a piece of code executes

### Day 62: November 18, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Advance Conditionals with Methods in Ruby part 2

**Thoughts:** Ruby uses short cercuit evaluation, which mean that it wont evaluate all the condition in the code. It will only evaluate conditions until it find something wrong. For example in an if statement, if the first condition was wrong, it will skip the condition that is after it and move to the next step.

Conditions can be nested together using multi "if statements" inside each other. There is another way to do the same thing in one line, and it is by using the and "&&" symbol, which represent and. In other hand you can use the OR "||" operator to evaluatre a condition where if only one is true, you will want to execute the code.

I will only recommend to use nested if statements if the condition is complicated. Nesting if statement will make the code more clear in that case.

Refactoring the code is making the code more clear. for example, you dont have to check if a boolean is a boolean, you can just check it's truthiness and falsiness. The same thing work for strings, because strings are actually truthly value.

You can use parentheses to group conditionals together which will make the code more clear to read. The other function is to actually execute the code within the parentheses before the code outside it.

### Day 63: November 19, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Advance Conditionals with Methods in Ruby part 3

**Thoughts:** Ruby does not care much of what the object is but, Ruby care of what it can do with the object a lot more.

`.respond_to()?` method is a method that allow you to check if the object is responsive to a method. You can use this method as a condition to only run a method on an object if that method actualy responsive to it.

You can use the symbol instead of a string as an argument in the `.respond` method to cut off all the extra things of what ruby think of when dealing with strings. A symbol is basically a string without all the extra methods that work on a string.

Ternary operator is used when you want to make a simple if statement. As the name suggest, it is an operator that will have three movements. It is clean one line of code.

Sometimes you may want to specify a default parameter for a method where it expect a parameter. It is optional but prefarable. I perfare to add default parameters when I am calling a method inside another method.

### Day 64: November 20, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Advance Conditionals with Methods in Ruby part 4

**Thoughts:** The "case statement" In Ruby allows us to replace multiple "if else and elsif statements". So in the condition when you want to check a large ammount of conditions, this statement is perfarable and much cleaner.

While making conditions, you may want to negate something. In Ruby, the negation operator is the "!". Negation will give a boolean answer. You can also use the negate negation operator which is represented by the operator "!!" and it will negate the negation.

The `unless` keyword, is used inplace of the `if` keyword in a conditional statement if you are going to put a condition that is negated.

### Day 65: November 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Statement modifires, loops and more Conditions in Ruby

**Thoughts:** The `while` keyword will create a loop. This mechanisim is very useful to iterate a line of code multiple of times without writing it over and over again. Remember to not make an infinite loop and always put a condition to end the loop.

The `until` keyword is a complimentary to the while loop. What a `while` does is that it will continue executing while the condition is true, in the other hand what a `until` does is that it will continue to execute until the condition is true.

You can reduce the number of lines in an if statement by using the inline modifire. Remember inline modifire must only be used when the body of the if statement is one line long. If you have a more complex operation, just stick to the normal if statement design. You can use this modifire with the unless statement too.

The conditional assignemtn operator `||=` will only assign the value to a variable if the current value of the variable is nil. It is a great way to optimise your program.

### Day 66: November 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Advanced ranges in Ruby

**Thoughts:** Ranges stores a sequence of numbers or letters, It start from one point and it include all the values from that one point to the next point. There are two ways to represent a range in Ruby. The first is with two dots, It will include the last character in the sequence. The second is with three dots, It will exclude the last character in the sequence.

You can use methods with ranges, `.first` mehtod will get the first character. the `.last` method will get the last character. Remember the `.last` method will include the last point even if you used the three dots method to exclude the last point of the range. These two methods also take parameters, which you can get the first two numbers by calling the `.first(2)` method with one parameter that represent how many point you would want to get.

Many other methods work on the range object in Ruby, for example the `.size()` method will get the size of the range, and the `.include()` mehtod will check and see if the parameter is included inside the range object. You can also use the `===` symbol to simulate the same job of the `.include()` method.

You can generate random number in ruby by using the `.rand()` method. You can also round a number by using the `.round()`method. In combination with Ruby ranges, you can generate random numbers in a range.

### Day 67: November 23, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Advance Array in Ruby part - 1

**Thoughts:** You can make an array with numbers, strings, booleans or and combination of these. You can make arrays inside of an array. They call them multideminsional arrays.

* Everything in Ruby is an object
* An array is an ordered collection of objects
* The array itself is an object. It acts as a container for other objects
* An array is created with a pair of square brackets

Usually you will create array using the bracket syntax, there is a shorthand syntax to create array. And it is by using the `%w[]` symbol. This way, it will treat every space inside the bracket as the beginning of a new array. The advantage is that you can type a long array very fast, without the need to comma every object inside of it. 

Sometimes you want to create array using the class method. `Array.new` is an advance way to create array. This method can take two parameters`Array.new(parameter1, parameter1)`. the first one is responsible on how many objects inside the array, the second represent what is the objects are.

To make use of an array, there are a lot of methods that you can apply on. For example the `.length()` method to get information on how long the array is. You can use the same method to know the position of the data in the array too. You can extract things from the array by using the `.fitch()` method. Just remember if the index position does not exist, it will output an error. You can hendel that error from the method by adding the second parameter in the `.fitch()`method. The second parameter will represent what will be outputted if the index number does not exist.

At the core, Ruby uses a method to call on data from an array. And that method is represented by this symbol`.[]()`. The parentheses is optional but it hold the index position.

### Day 68: November 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Advance Array in Ruby part - 2

**Thoughts:** The most useful usage of an array is the act of extracting data from the array. You can call the index number to extract that position data, but sometimes you want to get more than one data at a time. Instead of specifying only the index position, you can also specify the index position and how many items after the index position you want to get out. Just remember that the extracted items is still going to be an array.

You can also use ranges to extract data if you perfare doing that. Another way is by using the `.values_at()` method. The `.slice()` method is identical to the square bracket method. You can use the `.size()` and the `.length()` method to get the length of the array. You can use the `.count()` method which operate similar to size and length but you can count how many. It also let you add parameters to chose what to count. You can use the `.empty?()` and the `.nil()` method to check if the length of the array is zero or not. This method will not check if the object is truthely or falsly, it will just see if it is empty or not.`.first()` and  `.last()` methods take an argument index number that can return it as an array.

Changing the data of the array is also one of the usful things you can do with an array. You can do this by reasign the index to another value. Another functionality is adding new data to an array. you can do that by asigning a new index and a value to the array. By combining functionalities, you can overwrite data and change them. You can also do some testing on array, for example by using the methods `.nil?` or `.empty?`.

### Day 69: November 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Advance Array in Ruby part - 3

**Thoughts:** Array is very useful in combination with Ruby Method. Just remember to return a seprate diffrent array from the Method and not to modify the origional one.

You can add data into the end of an array by using the `.push()` method. You can do this also by using the shovel operator. However if you want to chose in what position to add data in the array, you can use the `.insert()` method. This method takes two arguments, the first is for the starting position and the second is for what data you want to add. Another way to add data to the array is by adding it in the beginning of the array, and you can do that by using the `.unshift()` method.

You can remove data from the end of an array by using the `.pop()` method. You can also specify how many items you want to remove by adding the number as an argument to the  method. Another method that will remove data from an array is the `.shift()` method.

You can compare an array with another one by using comparision operators. A new operator is the rocket or spaceship `<=>` operator, this operator will return three values or a nil depending on the data given. will give zero if both is equal to one another, will give "-1" if the left side is greater than the right side, and will give "+1" if the right side is greater than the left side.

You can convert range to an array by using the `.to_a` method. Remember to not confuse this method with the `.to_a?()` method. The second method is a method that will check the type of the object acording to its class, a function similar to the `.class` method.

### Day 70: November 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Advance Array in Ruby part - 4

**Thoughts:** You can use make use of an array inside a ruby block when you want to loop through data. Usually the `.each` method will do the trick. To optimize the program a bit, you can call methods on the elements right away inside the block. You can even optimize the code more by calling the `.each` method on the array without defining the array and then use the `.each` method. Remember that the variables that is created inside the block will not go on global scope of the program, those local variables will not exist after the block job is ended.

Everything within the Ruby block will be thrown out of memory as soon as the block is done executing. However, there is a way to store some of the data that a block will deal with in a seprate holder, an array for example. This way you can use the data somewhere else. Remember, you can always refacter the code to look more clear and understandable. Eventually I suggest wraping an important code in a method, so it will be more useful in the long run. You can also nest `.each` method. 

Solving the same problem in a diffrent way help in building more understanding in programming.

### Day 71: November 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** More on Loops in Ruby

**Thoughts:** Another way that we can iterate through elements is the "for loop". A for loop in Ruby is as much the same as `.each` loop but it does not create a variable at the local scope. So the for loop will preserve the variable into a global scope. I generaly perfare to write the each loop in ruby for security reasons as in I dont want data to leak out of the block.

The "Each Loop" can be very useful in times when you want to track index numbers in acording to the element. You can do this by using the `.each_with_index` method. This is not an extention to the `.each` method, It is another method that will act exactly as the `.each` method with a functionality to get the index number if you provided the request as an argument. You can name the argument as you wish, it does not have to be index.

When you want to create a new array where that new array is a result of appling some kind of operation to every single kind of element in another array. You can use `.map()` and `.collect` both methods has the same functionality. What those two methods will do is that they will return back a new array with the chosen operation. Just remember to not use `puts` because it will output `nil`.

### Day 72: November 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** More on Iteration and arrays

**Thoughts:** Ruby focuses on object orianted design and offer a lot of method flexability where other programming languages don't. One of this flexabilities is the "while or Until loops". The while loop can use the index position to increment and move through elements one by one. You can utilize the `break` keyword to break out of a loop or a block.

A complimentary keyword to the `break` is the `next` keyword. What `next` does is, move to the next iteration of the loop or block. You can structure these keywords anywhere you want, in an if statements, iterations or methods. Just remember, `next` is use whenever you want to go to the next thing and `break` is when you want to stop from going ahead.

A lot of methods can be used with arrays like the `.reverse` method which will reverse the array. You can use the `.sort()` methid to sort the array, from smallest to biggest or you can chain it with reverse. Remember uppercase letters come before lowercase letters. You can use the `.concat` method on an array to concat another array to the end of it.

### Day 73: November 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** More array methods and iteration

**Thoughts:** `.max()` & `.min()` methods on an array. The max method will return the larges value in an array, the min method will return the lowest value in an array. Using those two mithods on string will sort the strings and return one element, In the max you will get the last and the min you will get the first. Another useful method in ruby is the `.include?()` method which will look for a specified element in an array. 

If you want to provide an argument of an array element and want ruby to give back its relative index position within the array you can make use of the `.index()` and the `.find_index()` methods. Remember, this method will return the first index of the element it finds. In other hand, if you want to extract elements that only fit a certin condition, you may want to use the `.select()` method. You also have the opposite method of the select method and it is called `.reject()` method.

You can unpack arrays by assigning them into a variable, or you can use the `.partition()` method to call, select and reject in the same time in a single step, then it will give you back a multideminsional array, where the first represent the elements selected and the second represent the element that rejected.

### Day 74: November 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Advance String methods in Ruby

**Thoughts:** The `.split()` method when it is called on a string object it will return an array. The array will seprate the string of characters by default with space. It is the same as if you provided an argument to the method as a space (" "). However, you can also provide an empty string argument ("") to seperate each letter in the string. There is another way to achieve this, it is by using the `.chars()` method.

Strings has there own iteration method, `.each_char` which does the same as the `.each` method. You can combine the `.chars` and the `.each` method so you dont have to use the `.each_char` method if you like.. .

There is a method called `.join()` which at first i though it will concatnate strings but no, its functionality can work as concatenation if you wishes to, but it has more than just that. You see, the `.join` method can have arguments, and those argument are the glue that hold the string together. For example if you used the dot "." as an argument, the `.join` method will glue the string with the dot in between.

The `.count` method return the number of occurences that you provide of a sub-string, where the sub-string represent the argument that you give to the count method.

`.index` & the `.rindex()` Both will return the index position on the first occurance or the last occurance of the sub-string you pass in as an argument. Remember `nil` will retrun if nothing is returned from these two methods. The default behaviour of this method is to return the first index position it finds. However, you can provide another argument to the method that specify on what index position to start the search. This way, you have more acuracy. The `rindex()` method does the same in reverse.

You can add character from a specified index position using the `.insert()` method. You can remove any character that occure more than once in a row in a string by using the `.squeeze()` method. If you want to clear the string you can use the `clear()` method, in other hand the `delete()` method let you specify what characters you want to delete from a string.

### Day 75: December 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Object pointers and copies in Ruby

**Thoughts:** All Ruby objects live on the heap, an area of computer memory. Ruby creates space for each object on the heap, an object returns a refrence to its memory address when it is created. Variables do not hold the object, they hold the refrence to the object. for example, if the object is the house, the variable is the address.

In the case of pointers to the same object, if a variable is assigned to another variable, it will point to the same object. The variable becomes an alias for the object, so, any modification to the object will be reflected in both variables. In order to check for this, you can use the object_id method, which returns an object's location memory.

The `object_id` method will get the location of the memory which the object is stored in. It is important to keep in mind the id location because any modification to that id location will change any variable asigned to that id. Usually it will be prefarable to make another original copy and not use the same Id. You can do that by using the `dup()` method. This method will duplicate the array but it will not assign the origional and copy to the same id, it will be a duplicate with a seprate id and location in the memory. Using the `dup()` method will create a seprate copy.

### Day 76: December 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** More Advanced array methods in Ruby

**Thoughts:** There is a way to get any numbers of arguments in a ruby Method for example by using the splat arguments. they are represented by the symbol of `*` in arguments. Another intersting method is the Union method, which is represented by the `|` pipe character. The union method combines multiple arrays into one, and then remove any duplicate from that final array. Another behaviour is intersting is the `-` minus sign, when it is used on another array, this will trigger a function to remove the items from the left side array that exist in the right side array. In other hand you can get the elements that present in both arrays by using the `&`. more like the math function "intersection".

`.any?()` and `.all?()` are boolian methods that return true of false. You can use them like a condition. Similar to the "and/or" logic.

`.find()` and `.detect()` methods return the first value of an array that fit the condition you provided in a block.

`.uniq()` method returns back a new array with all of the duplicates of the origional array removed.

`.compact()` method remove all nil values from an array, then it will return a new array with new values with nil removed.

`.inject()` and `.reduce()` methods are the same, and they are used when you use iteration on an array and you want to keep track of some kind of an operation for all element prior to the one you are currently on.

`.flatten()` is a useful method that will take a multideminisional array and will return one array diminsion.

`.zip()` Method combines elements together based on a common index position.

`.sample()` can extract one or more random element from the array.

`.multiply()` method will repeat or multiply an array.

### Day 77: December 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** The Hash Ruby Object

**Thoughts:** A hash or a hash map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, they resumble dictionaries, maps or associative arrays. A hash object connects unique identifiers to values, this identifier is nammed a key.

You can create a hash by using the `{}` and asign it to a variable. You can use the big arrow `=>` sign to asign the key value pairs inside the Ruby hash. Another way to write a hash without the thick arrow, is to use symbol.

You can call the value you want from the hash by calling its key in a square brackets `[]`. If you tried to call something that doesnt exist in the hash, you will get a nil value.

You can create a light wheight string by creating a Ruby symbol `:`. A symbol will have less methods that can be assosiated with it. You can check the methods that is assosiated with anything in ruby by calling the `.methods()`. You can convert symbol to strgin by using the `.to_s()` method.

You can use methods on hashes too. `.fetch()` method return the value if it exist in the hash, but the more intersting is that this method can take two arguments, the first is the key, the second is what to return if the key doesnt exist.

You can add a new key to the hash by using the `.store()` method, remember it will imediatly modify the hash. You can change the value of an existing key by assigning a new value.

A hash is empty only when its length is zero. you can check the length of a hash by using the `.length()` method or check if the length is zer by using the `.empty?()` method.

### Day 78: December 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** more methods and usage on Hashes in Ruby

**Thoughts:** Hash keys and hash values can be objects of any type, the keys must be unique which mean they need to not have any duplicates, the values can contain duplicates. Hashes should be treated as unordered, values are extracted by their key, not by their order. You can convert a hash into an array by using the `.to_a` method.

To iterate on every element in the hash you can use the same `.each()` or `.each_pair()` method that can be used on arrays. It will iterate on every key, value pair witin the hash. Now Ruby technically keep track of the order of the pairs but you should not utilize this, because whenever you want to store something in sequence or order, you always stick with an array.

`.each_key()` and `.each_value()` methods are very helpful in combination with hashes, These two methods will iterate over there respectful component over  the hash. In other hand, if you just want to tetrieve the keys you can use the `.keys()` mehtod, or if you want to retrieve just the valuse, you can use the `.values()` method.

I tried to call a key that does not exist in a hash, and the value returned is "nil". A better way to handel such situation is to give a default value. The syntax of building a default hash is a bit diffrent than a normal hash. Because you need to call the `Hash.new` class and method on the hash. another way to set the default is to use the `.default()` method on the hash.
