### Day 1: September 18, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Installed Ruby on my computer and coded my first console app. I also learned two different ways to print data into the console screen. Using "puts" and "print".

**Thoughts:** The syntax is simple. and the output will be automatically defined as a string if it is enclosed in quotations.
I really struggled with installing ruby on my windows computer, It toke me more than an hour. But overall, I managed to install it and test run my "Hello World". If you are using windows, it is better to use ruby installer to get the installation faster.

If anyone want to get into ruby, start with the official site and you will find your way: [ruby-lang](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
