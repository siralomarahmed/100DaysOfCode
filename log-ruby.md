# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Ahmed A. M. Alomar

## Ruby

Released in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto anslo known as ("Matz")

Ruby is a:
1. high-level programming language
2. an interpreted language
3. Object-orianted programming language
4. Open-source
5. Ruby on Rails backend


Main Commitment

I will code in **Ruby** programming language for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.

Start Date:  
September 18th, 2019.

### Day 1: September 18, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Installed Ruby on my computer and coded my first console app. I also learned two different ways to print data into the console screen. Using "puts" and "print".

**Thoughts:** The syntax is simple. and the output will be automatically defined as a string if it is enclosed in quotations.
I really struggled with installing ruby on my windows computer, It toke me more than an hour. But overall, I managed to install it and test run my "Hello World". If you are using windows, it is better to use ruby installer to get the installation faster.

If anyone want to get into ruby, start with the official site and you will find your way: [ruby-lang](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

### Day 2: September 19, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Learned the Basics of ruby String Methods.

**Thoughts:** As expected from an object orianted programming (OOP) methods are always present. the syntax is also very simple. By using the dot (.) after the string, you can apply a method into the string. Well, I learned about these methods today:
```ruby
 .upcase
 .downcase
 .capitalize
 .reverse
 .length
```

### Day 3: September 20, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basics of Variables in Ruby

**Thoughts:** Variables in ruby must start with lowercase letters. Because classes uses the capitalize naming convention.. well, I don't know about that, I will have to wait until I get into classes, well, ruby classes that is ^^/. Aside from that, I had fun creating variables in ruby today.

Ruby variables is also self declarative as you dont have to declare a string before you assign a string to a variable. I had to use some of yesterday string methods with the variables to make things much more intersting.

### Day 4: September 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned the basics of getting user input in Ruby

**Thoughts:** By using `gets` to get the user input, you can store the input into a seperate variable to use it later. for example, I use it to print it out on the console screen by using `puts`

### Day 5: September 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Basic String concatenation and interpolation.

**Thoughts:** I realized that `puts` and `gets` will give a newline in the putput. So, I make use of a new string method `.chomp`. this method will just chop off the new line givin after the `gets`.
So cool, I ended up simulating a comversation using what I learned so far.
